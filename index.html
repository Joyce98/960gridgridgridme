  <h2>Tap into the power of the original.</h2>
  <h2>960 Grid</h2>
  
  <p>It was in 2005 that we all decided we should always use only 12-columns on every single website.</p>
  
  <p>Those columns should be equal width, and have 10px gutters.</p> 
  
  <p>While the industry has switched from fixed-width to responsive, from 960 to Bootstrap, we all still agree, we must use 12 columns. (Or maybe 16).</p>
  
  <p>It is in this vein that we have created an ultra-modern Grid Layout-based grid framework for 2017. Thus the name:</p>
  
  <h1>960 grid Grid grid</h1> 
  <h3>Why use anything but 12 columns?™</h3>
