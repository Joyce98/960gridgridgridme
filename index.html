  <h2>Tap into the power of the original.</h2>
  <h2>960 Grid</h2>
  
  <p>It was in 2005 that we all decided we should always use only 12-columns on every single website.</p>
  
  <p>Those columns should be equal width, and have 20px gutters.</p> 
  
  <p>We may have switched from fixed-width to responsive, and from 960 to Bootstrap, but we all still agree. A 12-column grid is all we will ever need.</p>

  <h3>These projects all agree:</h3>
  
  <p>[Insert logos of Bootstrap, Foundation, others]</p>
  
  
  <p>It is in this vein that we have created an ultra-modern CSS Grid Layout-based Grid Framework for 2017. Thus the name:</p>
  
  <h1>The 960-grid Grid grid</h1> 
  <h3>Why use anything but 12 columns?™</h3>

    <h2>Coming Soon: 960-grid Grid grid Responsive Edition</h2>
    
    <p>Where we predetermine which breakpoints will work best for your project. (Even though we have no idea what you are making.)</p>
    
    <p>We'll have all the breakpoints you need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>small phone</li>
      <li>medium phone</li>
      <li>large phone</li>
      <li>small tablet</li>
      <li>medium tablet</li>
      <li>large tablet</li>
      <li>medium desktop</li>
      <li>large desktop</li>
      <li>extra-large desktop</li>
      <li>*and by desktop we actually mean laptop. We call it desktop to make sure we all agree this computer will never be mobile and will always have a fast internet connection exactly like the one in your office.</li>
      <li>*we don't have any real desktop computer screen sizes, because we haven't thought about those computers much lately.</li>
      <li>*we will not include television sizes, because who uses their television to get online? Besides all the people with new gaming consoles. Or maybe anyone who watches TV.</li>
      <li>*and we won't be thinking about watches or other tiny screens, because we think Apple screwed up the iWatch and this market is dead.</li>
      <li>"Accessibility"? Everyone can access our website — what are you talking about?</li>
    </ul>
