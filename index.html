  <h2>Tap into the power of the original.</h2>
  <h2>960 Grid</h2>
  
  <p>It was in 2005 that we all decided we should always use only 12-columns on every single website.</p>
  
  <p>Those columns should be equal width, and have 20px gutters.</p> 
  
  <p>We may have switched from fixed-width to responsive, and from 960 to Bootstrap, but we all still agree. A 12-column grid is all we will ever need.</p>

  <h3>These projects all agree:</h3>
  
  <p>[Insert logos of Bootstrap, Foundation, and others]</p>
  
  
  <p>It is in this vein that we have created an ultra-modern CSS Grid Layout-based grid framework for 2017. Thus the name:</p>
  
  <h1>The 960-grid Grid grid</h1> 
  <h3>Why use anything but 12 columns?â„¢</h3>
