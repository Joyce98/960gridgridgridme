##Video all about it

All of the restrictions of a 12-column grid with none of the superpowers of CSS Grid Layout.

Why write your own CSS when you can download the 150 lines of code that I wrote. It has nothing to do with your design or your project, but maybe you'll use some of it.

Why learn Grid Layout when you could learn our 3rd-party tool instead. We'll probably only support this project for a few years, before we get bored and move on to something else. CSS Grid will be a permanent part of the web â€” forever! That's a long time to commit to knowing something. If you learn Grid Layout, you'll be gaining a skill you'll use for the rest of your career. Who'd want that? By learning a 3rd party tool that goes away, you'll guarantee you'll need to learn another one.
